# D-Ranking

## Description:

An app like Hacker News, or like Reddit but with cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrencies will be used for voting news articles and posts. 

## Problem Statement:

As of now Facebook and Google decide the ranking algorithms in their platform. This causes too much centralization. This centralization causes data manipulation and monopoly of data. 

## Solution:

When cryptocurrencies are used to Upvote an article/post, it gets recorded in the blockchain. So other apps can use that data with different ranking algorithms. 

Apps can use ranking parameters like
1. Number of upvotes/cryptos for a post
2. Time since posted
3. Spam content on the post
4. Content-based filtering recommendation system. Users are shown post   similar to what they have upvoted.
5. Collaborative based filtering recommendation system. Users are shown posts which their friends have liked. If two people have transacted, they can be assumed to have had friends.
